# Eclipse-to-Studio
This repository is an attempt to share urls (Blog, Stackoverflow etc) and other useful information regarding migrating from Eclipse to Android Studio.

After the release of first stable version (and the subsequent removal of all content related to Eclipse from developer.android.com), people are now thinking (or forced) to migrate to Android Studio. 

(I hate the idea of changing the dev enviroment once you're settled. Its almost like migrating to a foreign country !! But hey, what if a small amount of friction now helps in the long run ? )

You might be at various stage - 

- Just started off with projects.
- Small dev shop with couple of projects.
- Large complex projects.

This repo is to create resources for each of these categories and help them migrate to Studio.Hence its a collaborative process, so dig in and try to help out! Do send a pull request, please!
